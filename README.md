# 🚑 Ambulance Allocation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed to address the critical issue of ambulance shortages and delays in Tunisia, where many lives are lost due to the lack of proper transportation to hospitals. 

To mitigate this problem, I, **Houssam Eddine Ben Kheder**, a **2nd-year student at ESPRIT, Tunisia**, developed an application that optimizes ambulance dispatching to hospitals in need.

## 🔍 Key Features
### 🚑 Ambulance Management
- Efficient allocation of ambulances to hospitals based on **real-time needs**.
- Integration with the **hospital's entity**, taking into account:
  - **History of hospital creation**
  - **Number of patients**
  - **Emergency levels**
- **Live tracking** and dispatch system to improve response time.

### 📊 Statistics & Analytics
- Collect and analyze **historical patient data**.
- Monitor **hospital demands** for ambulances over time.
- Generate **real-time reports** for better decision-making.

### 🗺️ Map Localization & Patient Detection
- **Geolocation system** to detect patients in need.
- Integrated with **real-time maps** to direct ambulances to the nearest available hospital.

### 🏥 Smart Parking System (Arduino Integration)
- Implemented an **Arduino-based parking solution** for ambulances using:
  - **RFID** for automated access control.
  - **Ultrasound sensors** for detecting available parking spots.
  - **Rolling engines** for automated gate opening and closing.
- Ensures ambulances can **park efficiently** upon arrival.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++ (Qt Framework)
- **Mapping & Localization:** Google Maps API
- **Hardware:** Arduino (RFID, Ultrasound Sensors, Rolling Engine)

## 📅 Project History
This project was initiated **2 years ago** as a response to the growing issue of emergency transportation inefficiencies. Over time, it evolved to include:
1. **Basic ambulance-hospital assignment** (Initial Phase)
2. **Hospital patient tracking & history integration** (Enhancement Phase)
3. **Statistics & analytics for improved ambulance distribution** (Optimization Phase)
4. **Smart Parking System using Arduino** (Hardware Integration Phase)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- AI-driven **ambulance dispatch prediction** based on hospital demand trends.
- **Mobile App** for hospitals and ambulance drivers for seamless coordination.
- IoT-based **real-time vitals monitoring** inside ambulances.
